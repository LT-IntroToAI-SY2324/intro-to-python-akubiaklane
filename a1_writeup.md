# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
That it's easier than java and it seems more simple to understand so far.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Python and Java are both object oriented programming languages. Python doesn't need semi colons at the end of each line. A lot of things are written differently or work differently in python than in Java, like for loops. It seems like an easier language.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned the basics of Python and some things I didn't know about like slicing lists.
